# My name is Mike Sturm. I write about productivity and personal growth. Below are the things I’ve done and things I’m currently doing.

[**The Today System**](https://thetodaysystem.com)<br>
A simple, yet scalable personal productivity system, based around the humble 3 x 5″ index card.
<br>
<br>
[**Woolgathering**](https://woolgathering.substack.com)<br>
 A newsletter for the intellectually promiscuous. I share my own writing on various topics related to productivity and personal growth, as well as other interesting content and book recommendations.
<br>
<br>
**Getting Things Done in Google Sheets**<br>
It’s a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PUM1GRYXoXkuXDiGuWiF4ubWll441h8S-70ZnP25LM/)!<br>
It’s a [course on Skillshare](http://skl.sh/2n30RCj)! It’s both!<br>
A way to implement David Allen’s famous *GTD* productivity system inside a single spreadsheet.
<br>
<br>
[**Be, Think, Do**](https://www.amazon.com/Be-Think-Do-Development-Productivity-ebook/dp/B07MQS2YHD)<br>
My first (and self-published) book. A collection of essays on productivity, self-improvement, and the deeper aspects of that thing we call “work”.
<br>
<br>
[**The Wabi-Sabi Way**](https://www.amazon.com/Wabi-sabi-Way-Principles-Meaning-Authenticity/dp/1641528265)<br>
A book about the lost art of being more accepting, and thus more effective. It’s a combination of a crash-course in Eastern thought and self-improvement book.
