<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](http://www.mikesturm.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GTD-GS-image-1024x576.jpg)</figure>I have been interested in David Allen’s *Getting Things Done* methodology for a long time. I have also long been a fan of productivity apps–for many platforms.

My problem has been that I never found that one program that would work with GTD the way I do. Nothing was the right fit–and I have tried *many* of them.

Little did I know, the answer had been staring me in the face every day at my day job: *spreadsheets!* They are simple enough to keep my GTD system running in one place, but powerful enough to make my workflow more efficient. Specifically, Google Sheets has become powerful enough (and has robust enough apps for iOS and Android) to work well on nearly any device.

I wrote a long piece featured in *Better Humans* about just how I use Google Sheets to run GTD, which [you can find here ](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-implement-a-killer-gtd-system-in-google-sheets-ad9c9857a8bd)(behind a metered paywall).

Below is the template that I designed for running my GTD system in Google Sheets.
