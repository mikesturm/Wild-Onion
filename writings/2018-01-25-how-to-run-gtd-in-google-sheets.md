I’ve been a fan of David Allen’s *Getting Things Done* for years now. It changed the way I approach not only work, but life. Breaking things down into projects, next actions, or reference — and separating things into what I’m committed to doing now or what I am okay with doing later has been key in getting to where I am today.

But I always struggled with how to implement it from a software standpoint. You see, a piece of software is a tool. And as most developers can tell you, if you don’t *love* the application that you use to do *X* in, your chances of staying engaged in the process of getting *X* done go down significantly. In that sense, the right tool (or here, the right application) can make all the difference.

I tried numerous apps as the tool for running GTD in my life, and I always found something in their mechanics that kept me from really *loving* them. So I was less than engaged with my personal productivity system — which is a big problem.

I’ve been using spreadsheets for a while now at my day job, and gotten pretty handy with them. But it wasn’t until recently that I put together my love of and proficiency with spreadsheets and my love of GTD and personal productivity. The result is something that might just be powerful enough (because it’s *simple* enough) to run a GTD implementation cross-platform and in the cloud, with the fewest pitfalls.

For anyone who has struggled with implementing GTD in the various personal productivity apps, this might be the solution for you. I know it was for me. I now have a workflow and tool that I am confident in. For anyone trying to hone their productivity, you know that’s more than half the battle.

It comes complete with a powerful template that you can use to start running your own GTD system in Google Sheets today.

Just click [this link](http://skl.sh/2n30RCj) to get started. It will allow you to try out Skillshare for 3 months for just $0.99 — which gives you access to all of their classes. I’ve already used Skillshare to take courses on things from learning coding, getting educated on blockchain technology, and time-blocking. That’s probably the best ROI on a dollar that I’ve ever gotten.

The course consists of 12 video lessons (with screencasts, template, and workflow document) that I crafted to give you the best crash course in both GTD methodology and running it effectively in a spreadsheet. Check it out, and let me know what you think (info@mikesturm.net)!
